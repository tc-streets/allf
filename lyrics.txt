Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come.
T'was grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home.

The sword of time will pierce our skins
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works its way on in
The pain grows stronger watch it grin, but

The thought of suicide is a great consolation: by means of it one gets through many a dark night.

And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.
